### Testdome Problem: Life Period
```
A developer needs to write a function for converting age (a whole number), into life period using the following algorithm:

If age is zero, it should return INVALID,
If age is greater than zero and less than 16, function should return CHILD,
If age is greater than or equal to 16, function should return ADULT.
Define the optimal (effective and efficient) set of boundary test cases to test the function.
