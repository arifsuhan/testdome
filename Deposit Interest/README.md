### Testdome Problem: Deposit Interest

An informational interest rate calculator for a fixed term deposit needs to be tested. For a given deposit amount and the clientâ€™s age, the calculator shows the annual interest rate.

The following rules apply:
1. The minimum deposit amount is $100.
2. The maximum deposit amount is $10,000.
3. The annual interest rate depends on the deposit amount as follows:

| Deposit amount | Annual interest rate |
| --- | ----------- |
| $100 - $999 | 1.0% |
| $1,000 - $4,999 | 1.3% |
| $5,000 - $10,000 | 1.5% |
4. Only adults (aged 18 and older) are eligible to open a term deposit account.
5. Clients aged 60 and older have a fixed interest rate of 2%.
